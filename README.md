 Some things I've built:  
- First block sniping
- Pump.fun bundlers/snipers
- LP Analytics and scam token detection/bundler filtering
- Bundler, freeze bundler
- Volume Generators
- MEV
- Copy trade bots
- Etc

If you want me to build you something, add me and give me the details. There's a good chance I've built it or am able to.

I've decided to open source everything I've written since people are selling the code I've given them or helped them with for a profit, using it to charge people fees, or are straight up pretending they wrote it.  

Definitely do not run any obfuscated code, if you need help running anything you find here just add me and I'll walk you through any errors. discord: shadowystupidcoder
